                <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <p>
                If you want to learn more about what goes into computers--whether it be for the sake of
                building a custom desktop, being more informed as a consumer and therefore making a better
                purchase of a “pre-build,” or desktop sold by a company that is already completely assembled,
                or you are a technical specialist wanting to refresh your knowledge or learn more about the
                newest topic--it will first be beneficial to identify what PART of a computer you want to learn
                about. 
                <br>
                <br>
                We will first cover the basic components of an average computer, what they are, what
                functions they perform, and then will provide some more specific technical knowledge into
                how each component works.
            </p>
                <h2>Many Parts</h2>
            <p>

                Computers are made up of several fundamental parts. They are present in almost all computers.
                A good starting point is a component called the motherboard. Every computer has a motherboard.
                This is essentially a large circuit board that enables all of the other components to connect
                and talk to each other. (Research and provide more information.)
            </p>
                <h2>CPUs</h2>
            <p>
                The next component to consider is the central processing unit, or CPU. This is one of the most
                important parts of your computer. You've likely already heard that acronym at some point before.
                It does exactly what it's name would suggest: it processes the vast majority of information that
                contributes directly to whatever you're doing on your computer. (Research and provide more info.)

            </p>
                <h2>GPUs</h2>
            <p>
                Another similar component is the graphics processing unit, or GPU for short. This is similar, although
                it is responsible for rendering individual pixels, like in videos or video games. Not all computers
                have a GPU, but they are often built into the motherboard. But things like gaming or other taxing
                processes will certainly benefit greatly from a GPU! (Research and provide more information.)
            </p>
                <h2>Storage</h2>
            <p>
                We can next explore various storage types. The first will be a simple drive. This stores information.
                These are usually hard drives or solid state drives. (Research and provide more information.)
            </p>
                <h2>Random Access Memory</h2>
            <p>
                Next we will explore random access memory. (Research and provide more information.)
