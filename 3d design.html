    <h2>Intro to 3D Design</h2>
    <p>3D design is an intricate and extremely technical aspect of post-production in media.
        It requires great proficiency and a highly specialized skill set. Thankfully,
        these skills can be learned, and there is a wealth of information available on the subject.
    </p>
    <h2>Many Components</h2>
    <p>
        The first idea that one must have about 3D design is that 3D design has many facets to it.
        It is not one practice or study, but multiple. The most fundamental of these and perhaps the
        first step in any 3D design process is the acquisition of or creation of a model. This is
        usually referred to simply as 3D modeling.
    </p>
    <h2>3D Modeling</h2>
    <p>3D modeling involves either purchasing a model from a website, a freelancer, a company, etc.
        In fact, even some movies or franchises will sell the rights to their models! Many more freelancers
        and individual content creators will create replicas of these models, and sometimes with extreme
        detail and effort, resulting in a product that may be even more hyper realistic than what was
        created for the original artwork.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating Models</h2>
    <p>It is also possible to create your own 3D models. Most models work around providing simple geometric
        shapes that can then be contorted, altered, and shaped to create models like people, animals,
        characters, etc. Most models you see in movies and television actually started in a simple program
        from shapes like cubes and spheres!
    </p>
    <h2>3D Animation</h2>
    <p>The next component of 3D design, perhaps most commonly known, is animation. This involves using some
        3D software (which we will get into later) to program the movement of your 3D model. This is critical
        in media types like video game design and modern cinema. Animation can be applied to biological models
        like humans and animals, it can also be applied to machines and other 3D created objects (a good
        example is the Transformers series), or it can even be applied to simple 3D text seen in a movie
        trailer. Animation is just as vital to the process as modeling.
    </p>
    <h2>Programs and Software</h2>
    <p>
        With the fact that there are many different components of the 3D design subject, we can now explore
        the various programs and softwares available for different aspects of 3D design, what they do, some
        basic information about them, and what processes they specifically are used for. (Provide information
        about programs like the Unreal Engine, Blender, Cinema 4D, Video Copilotâ€™s Element 3D for Adobe After
        Effects, and others.)
